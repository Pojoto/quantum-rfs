Welcome to quantum_rfs's documentation!
=========================================================
This Python package is designed for you to implement real examples of the Recursive Fourier Sampling problem, 
additionally providing both classical and quantum solutions to the RFS problem. The quantum solution utilizes the 
Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, while the classical solution uses a brute-force recursion approach. Both methods can be compared
and visualized in the package. Check out the API page to see more concrete documentation on specific classes or methods.
